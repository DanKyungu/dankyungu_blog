I'm a software engineer passionate by .NET Development, on all platforms: Web, Desktop, AI/ML, Mobile and IoT using C#, with at least 9 years of development I've built some good applications most on mobile with Xamarin, web with Asp.Net Core, and desktop apps with Windows Presentation Foundation, Winform, UWP, Azure, React and so on ...

I really love to share any things I discover, or already know to others by doing lives, blog posts, video tutorials, in-person conferences, the preference I've above all kinds of development, is the Cross-Platform mobile development especially with Xamarin.
